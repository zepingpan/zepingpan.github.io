I’m Zeping Pan, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Accounting, and I’m delighted that you’ve taken the time to explore my academic and professional journey. Since joining the department in September 2019, I’ve been deeply involved in research that aims to elucidate the complex interplay between financial reporting and economic outcomes, particularly within the extractive industry.

My academic roots are anchored in an M.Sc. in Accounting, Valuation, and Financial Management, which I earned from the prestigious Stockholm School of Economics (SSE). This educational background has been foundational in shaping my research interests and equipping me with the analytical tools necessary for rigorous scholarly investigation.

Complementing my academic background is my status as an ACCA certified accountant. This professional designation not only certifies my expertise in accounting practices but also enriches my research by providing a real-world perspective on financial reporting’s impact on business and industry.

My current research project delves into the economic consequences of financial reporting in the extractive industry, a sector fraught with both opportunities and challenges. I am excited about the potential implications of this research for policy-making, industry practices, and the academic literature on financial reporting.

I’m thrilled to be a part of a vibrant community of scholars and professionals. If my research interests align with yours, or if you’re curious to explore collaborative opportunities, please feel free to get in touch.

Thank you for visiting my site.

Best regards, Zeping Pan
