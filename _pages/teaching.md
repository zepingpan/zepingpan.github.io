# Markdown Text Customization Guide

Markdown offers a variety of ways to customize and style text to enhance readability and presentation. Here's a guide to the common customizations available:

## 1. Headers

Markdown provides six levels of headers, created using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the header level:

\# H1  
\## H2  
\### H3  
\#### H4  
\##### H5  
\###### H6  

## 2. Emphasis

### a. Italics (Cursive)
Italicize text using a single asterisk `*` or a single underscore `_`:

*\italicized text* or \_italicized text_  

### b. Bold
Bold text using double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__`:

**\**bold text\** or \__bold text\__**  

### c. Bold and Italics
Combine bold and italics using three asterisks or underscores:

***\***bold and italicized text\**** or \___bold and italicized text\___***  

## 3. Lists

* Item 1
  * Sub-item 1.1
  * Sub-item 1.2
* Item 2

### a. Unordered Lists (Bullets)
Create bullet points using asterisks `*`, plus `+`, or hyphens `-`:

* Item 1  
+ Item 2  
- Item 3  

### b. Ordered Lists
For numbered lists, use numbers followed by a period:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## 4. Links

Embed links:

\[Link text here](URL here)  
Example: 
[zepingpan.com](http://www.zepingpan.com)  

## 5. Images

Embed images:

!\[Alt text here](Image URL)  

## 6. Horizontal Lines

Create a horizontal line using three hyphens `---`, asterisks `***`, or underscores `___`:

## 7. Underlining

Standard Markdown doesn't support underlining. However, if the platform supports inline HTML:

<u>underlined text</u>
