title={The Interplay between International Financial Reporting and Local Disclosure Rules: Evidence from Oil and Gas companies},
author={N. Hellman (SSE) and M. Ivanova (SSE) and Z. Pan (SSE)},
abstract={We examine the informational consequences of loosening the connection between financial statements and non-financial disclosures. We focus on the setting of Canadian oil and gas (O&G) firms, where IFRS adoption weakens the connection between financial reporting and the jurisdiction- and industry-specific O&G reserve disclosure. We find that while the O&G reserve estimates are not directly exposed to IFRS, the attenuated connection to financial statements affects the informativeness of these estimates. We propose that this connection influences the informativeness of reserve estimates through two channels: processing costs and perceived reliability. The processing cost view suggests that a clear linkage with financial statements reduces costs associated with awareness, acquisition, and integration of non-financial information. Consistently, we find decreased clarity in how reserves are mapped into financial statements and a diminished focus on reserve estimates during earnings conference calls. Regarding the reliability channel, we posit and find that the weakened connection impairs the credibility of non-financial information. Collectively, our results indicate that connection with financial statements affects the incorporation of non-financial information into users’ screening and monitoring.},

title={Discretionary Accounting Choices and Financial Statement Comparability: Evidence from Extractive Industries Pre- and Post-IFRS Adoption},
author={N. Hellman (SSE) and M. Ivanova (SSE) and Z. Pan (SSE)},
abstract={Extant literature suggests that IFRS adoption is associated with higher comparability. However, theoretical ambiguity surrounds how principles-based IFRS accounting standards improve comparability, especially when offering a larger set of accounting choices. This study investigates how introducing more accounting discretion affects financial statement comparability by examining the adoption of IFRS in extractive industries (EI), which increases discretion for accounting for exploration and evaluation (E&E) costs. Using a set of alternative comparability measures and model specifications, our results indicate that overall comparability decreases under IFRS 6 (Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources). Hand-collected data from annual reports show that a significant number of firms change their E&E accounting policies, contributing to increased diversity in firms’ accounting policies after the adoption of IFRS 6. We find that capital market incentives and other firm characteristics, such as small positive earnings and higher leverage, predict a firm’s decision to change E&E policy. Lastly, we document that while comparability is positively associated with information benefits for financial statement users, the changes in E&E accounting policies negatively affect the market’s assessment of accounting information. Our findings support the theoretical argument that increasing discretion in accounting standards introduces managerial opportunism. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of accounting discretion and its impact on information quality.},

title={Third-Party Specialists and Audit Engagements},
author={Z. Pan (SSE)},
abstract={This study examines the interaction between financial auditors and client-recruited third-party specialists. I exploit the unique regulatory setting of the Canadian Oil and Gas (O&G) industry where both a financial auditor and an independent geographical O&G reserve engineer are required and disclosed. Primary results indicate that assurance on O&G reserve estimates provided by top-ranked engineers reduces the misreporting risk perceived by auditors, indicated by reduced audit fees, without causing declines in output-based audit quality indicators, such as restatements or absolute discretionary accruals. This suggests that knowledge sharing between the two might enhance audit efficiency. This effect is stronger with more within- and cross-client interaction between auditors and engineers. However, I also find suggestive evidence that auditors with less industry experience and more resource constraints are relatively insensitive to engineers' past estimation performance, indicating that they may over-rely on the relationship.},

title={The CSR Spillover Effect through Analyst Coverage Network},
author={Z. Pan (SSE) and H.Tan (ESSEC)},
abstract={We study the spillover effect of CSR disclosure mandates through analyst coverage networks. We find evidence that U.S. firms improve their CSR practices when they share common analyst coverage with foreign firms that are subject to CSR disclosure mandates. Further analyses suggest that this spillover effect is more pronounced for analysts with a higher information processing ability and more forecast activities, as well as for firms with greater CSR risk exposures. Consistent with the informational role of analysts in shaping corporate practices, we observe an increase in CSR-related questions during earnings conference calls for the affected U.S. firms. Collectively, our findings indicate that analysts play a role in facilitating the spillover of CSR information and affecting firms' CSR practices.},
