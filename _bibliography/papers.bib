title={Discretionary Accounting Choices and Financial Statement Comparability: Evidence from Extractive Industries Pre- and Post-IFRS Adoption},
author={N. Hellman (SSE) and M. Ivanova (SSE) and Z. Pan (SSE)},
abstract={Extant literature suggests that IFRS adoption is associated with higher comparability. However, theoretical ambiguity surrounds how principles-based IFRS accounting standards improve comparability, especially when offering a larger set of accounting choices. This study investigates how introducing more accounting discretion affects financial statement comparability by examining the adoption of IFRS in extractive industries (EI), which increases discretion for accounting for exploration and evaluation (E&E) costs. Using a set of alternative comparability measures and model specifications, our results indicate that overall comparability decreases under IFRS 6 (Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources). Hand-collected data from annual reports show that a significant number of firms change their E&E accounting policies, contributing to increased diversity in firms’ accounting policies after the adoption of IFRS 6. We find that capital market incentives and other firm characteristics, such as small positive earnings and higher leverage, predict a firm’s decision to change E&E policy. Lastly, we document that while comparability is positively associated with information benefits for financial statement users, the changes in E&E accounting policies negatively affect the market’s assessment of accounting information. Our findings support the theoretical argument that increasing discretion in accounting standards introduces managerial opportunism. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of accounting discretion and its impact on information quality.},

title={The Interplay between International Financial Reporting and Local Disclosure Rules: Evidence from Oil and Gas companies},
author={N. Hellman (SSE) and M. Ivanova (SSE) and Z. Pan (SSE)},
abstract={We examine the informational effects of loosening the connection between parallel-existing financial reporting and jurisdiction- and industry-specific nonfinancial disclosures. We focus on the setting of Canadian oil and gas (O&G) firms, where IFRS adoption weakens the connection between financial reporting and O&G reserve reporting. We document a significant decrease in value relevance of O&G reserve disclosures after IFRS adoption. We posit and find that loosening connections with financial statements affects the informativeness of O&G reserve estimate by reducing its earning implications. Accordingly, we show that IFRS adoption changes firms' disclosure practices, leading to less precise and consistent accounting practices information regarding how O&G reserves are used as inputs for financial statements. Consistently, we find declined discussions on reserves during the Q&A section of conference calls. Finally, we find suggestive evidence that managers use the interaction between different mandatory disclosure channels strategically and IFRS adoption introduces reserve disclosure manipulation. Collectively, our results indicate a negative spillover effect on non-financial information associated with the transition from jurisdictionally tailored accounting standards to IFRS.},
